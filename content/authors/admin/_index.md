I am a PhD. candidate in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering department at USC  advised by [Prof. Assad Oberai](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Oberai/Assad).


My research interest lies at the intersection of physics-based and data-driven modeling, deep generative modeling, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification with applications to computational science and engineering, computer vision, and medical imaging. I am particularly interested in the question of how to optimally combine physics-guided models with modern machine learning algorithms to develop more data efficient and accurate hybrid models.
